                    Insured vehicle: Peugeot 308
                    passenger car with license plate 3195GRW.
                </p>
                <p>After the heavy rains that
                    occurred in the area, part of the slab that forms the roof of the garage came off, causing
                    considerable damage to three vehicles parked in the lower parking spaces.

                <p>

                    During our intervention, we
                    have been attended by: Neighbor

                </p>
                <p>

                    In person at the address of
                    the accident, we confirm that the place where the insured vehicle was parked at the time of the
                    events is not a public car park.
                    It is a private
                    garage of a single-family semi-detached house within the urban nucleus, whose owner has rented a
                    space from it to its neighbors to park their vehicles.
                    There is no rental contract.
                    For the payment of an undeclared fee, the different neighbors
                    have keys to the garage of this house to station their vehicles.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The claim and damage to the
                    insured vehicle stemmed from the collapse of the slab of the first floor of this house, the
                    collapse coinciding with the area of ​​the elevated exterior patio of this construction.
                    The damage to the insured vehicle is due to the impact of the
                    collapsed rubble of the wrought iron, not being crushed by them as it happens with other
                    vehicles.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Despite agreeing the visit
                    for the past day 10/03/2019, we cannot access the interior of the garage as it is sealed by the
                    police, as well as the entrance to the house, no technician from the town hall or body of the
                    police to give us access.
                    Put in contact with the
                    local police, we are confirmed that they have no notice of breach of the indicated home.

                </p>

                <p>

                    From two adjoining houses,
                    and with the permission of their respective owners, we can confirm the collapse of the part of
                    the slab that coincides with the upper patio outside the house where the garage is located and
                    the affected vehicles are parked.

                </p>

                <p>

                    After our on-site
                    inspection, and verification of the images provided of what happened at the time of the events,
                    we can determine that the drop in the indicated floor area is due to the deterioration of the
                    reinforced concrete joists.
                    It is verified how the
                    reinforcement of these transverse concrete joists that rest on two horizontal metal beams, has
                    swelled and deteriorated due to the permanent action of humidity, gradually losing mechanical
                    properties over time until finally reaching its point of collapse. coinciding this fact with the
                    heavy rains registered in the locality on the date of occurrence

                </p>


                <p>

                    of the
                    casualty.
                    Upon reaching the point of collapse, the
                    concrete joists break in the support zone, leading to the collapse of the floor.

                </p>

                <p>

                    It is verified that the
                    exterior patio above the area of ​​the collapsed garage is waterproofed with chlorine-rubber
                    paint, understanding that these circumstances are directly related to the events that occurred,
                    as this is not an element suitable for the given use.
                    The use of this material to waterproof the terrace area
                    prevents moisture from leaving the slab and drying out, so the moisture is latent in the
                    construction elements, leading to the early deterioration of its metal
                    reinforcement.
