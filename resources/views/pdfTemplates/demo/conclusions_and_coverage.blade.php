                Based on the circumstances of the claim, we determine that it is
                not a
                Consortium claim.

                The fall of the floor is directly
                and exclusively due to the deterioration of the reinforced concrete joists.
                We understand that the insurance of the home where the vehicles
                are
                parked may exclude Civil Liability damages due to undeclared use of your garage.
